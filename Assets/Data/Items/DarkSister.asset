  description: About sixty years after the death of Visenya, the sword was passed
    to Daemon Targaryen, the younger brother of King Viserys I Targaryen. While the
    sword is relatively thin due to it being made for a female warrior, it is still
    made from Valyrian steel which is still strong and sharp.
